# Python-Assignments

**"The best way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it."**

I admire this famous quote from Dennis Ritchie (Creator of C language). 

So, I implement this concept in learning Python.


These are the basic exercises to learn Python concepts thoroughly.

I referred many articles & blogs to explore these exercises.  

I made README files seperately for each folders. You can open them, read it and try to solve it.

If you solved every exercises, upload your files in Github and email me your git repo address @ `adivenkat65@gmail.com` or comment below.
